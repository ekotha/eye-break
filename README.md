I was just playing around with local extensions and wanted to build something that would help me keep track of how long I'd be staring at the screen. 
I was hoping to make something that would help remind me to take a break and add some serendipity to my sessions. 

So I figured...why not make it so that every 20 minutes, I get prompted with a random wikipedia page? Just like an annoying pop up, except it's not an ad but a chance for knowledge. 
I might learn something, notice that I've been working for quite a bit of time, and take a break. Basically, if I've seen more than 4 Wikipedia articles and I haven't gotten up once in that time, that's a good self-reminder to get moving. 

This is a silly serendipity extension. I had a lot of fun loading it locally and letting it run whenever I was browsing over a few weeks. 
You can change the timing to anything else, it doesn't have to be 20 minutes. Just take a peek at the code itself, it's pretty straightforward. 

This is by no means optimized or user friendly BUT if you want to build something around this, I'd actually be super happy to see what you come up with so say hi on twitter/x (@eashankotha) if you do!
